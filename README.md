For this project I wanted to create a clean, aesthetically pleasing website to showcase my personal coding projects and a little bit about me. I hope you enjoy!

## Coding Projects
 
### :sparkles: Podcast Website

Visit the [site](https://laurencolvin.github.io/Portfolio-Project-1/) and the [github](https://github.com/LaurenColvin/Portfolio-Project-1) repository.  

This was my very first coding project creating a website using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I decided to recreate my podcast website and showcase my new skills in flex box, responsive design and creating a functional nav bar and hamburger menu. 

### :sparkles: Critterpedia

Visit the [site](https://laurencolvin.github.io/project-2-react/) and the [github](https://github.com/LaurenColvin/project-2-react) repository.  

Critterpedia is a React App using third-party API data from the video game Animal Crossing. You can search for critters by month and add critters to your caught library. You can also view all bugs, fish or diving critters on their own pages. Scroll through to see all of the things you have yet to catch and plan your strategy based on month.
